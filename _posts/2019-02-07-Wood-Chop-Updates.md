# Finally got the website running smoothly. :D

### Below are some notes on what I've accomplished this last week.

##### I have gotten used to working pushing and pulling in git.

##### The Wood Chop project has been upgraded.  Better visuals and buttons.  Future upgrades include: a better shop UI, an inventory system, a passive way to stack wood, and a way to prevent hacking via console.

##### I need to add a footer to the site.
