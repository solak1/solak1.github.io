Wood Chop is officially released as "Version 1.0." I've gotten Wood Chop to the point where I can move on.  Its simple, but easy to play.  The color coded UI helps users know when to sell wood and when to buy axes.  There are room for improvements and I do have future goals, such as implemented an inventory UI.  Yet, I have accomplished the state that I envisioned for Wood Chop: a mindless click game that a braindead zombie could play.  

Wood Chop has helped me grow.  I have gotten comfortable working in jekyll and git.  My javascript skills are improving, but still very rough.  I think I need to take a full javascript course to fully understand the syntax, implement better data type, and write more efficient functions.

Wood Chop has also made me realize that I need to devote time to making web layouts.  My website is stuck in 2011: its somewhat clean, but fairly ugly; its capable of mobile usage, but not built for mobile users.  

I am torn between learning more javascript/javascript framework and working on HTML/CSS.  However, I think my HTML/CSS skills are more important to work on at this time.  For the next week, I am going to work on learning flexbox, grid, and scss.  I am also going to plan out my web development schedule.
